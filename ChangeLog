nodogsplash (0.9.9)

  * Fixed buffer overflow bug in ndsctl.
  * Improved SIGCHLD handling in gateway.c and util.c.
  * Added FirewallRulesets trusted-users and trusted-users-to-router.
    This permits customized access control for trusted users, as for
    authenticated users, with the same ruleset semantics, instead of
    always accepting all trusted packets.
  * Added EmptyRuleSetPolicy directives for .conf file. Permits optionally
    passing packets through to pre-existing firewall rules.
  * updated debian rules (for building debian package)
